00:00.001 --> 00:03.240
The map is up on the shelf at the top.

00:03.240 --> 00:07.720
You can see there's lots of other items on the shelf, too.

00:07.720 --> 00:11.160
If you can get the map without knocking anything else off

00:11.160 --> 00:13.800
the shelf, it's yours.

00:13.800 --> 00:18.160
If the map touches any of the items, you lose.

00:18.160 --> 00:19.480
But I'll let you try again.
