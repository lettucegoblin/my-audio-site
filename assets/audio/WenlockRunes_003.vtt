00:00.001 --> 00:03.440
Use the mouse to click on two matching tiles.

00:03.440 --> 00:05.440
You have to start from the outside

00:05.440 --> 00:08.280
and select tiles that are around the edges.

00:08.280 --> 00:09.380
When you've matched a pair,

00:09.380 --> 00:11.600
it will disappear from the screen.

00:11.600 --> 00:14.800
Keep going until all the tiles have been removed.

00:14.800 --> 00:15.640
Good luck.
