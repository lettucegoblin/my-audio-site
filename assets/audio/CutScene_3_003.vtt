Hmm. A gem of ice, huh? Well, funny thing about that. I don't have a gem of ice.

00:08.000 --> 00:15.000
But last year a man came through and said he found a rare diamond blue as ice.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
He hid the gem in a treasure chest and protected it with magic.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
Then he marked its location with a red flame.

00:24.000 --> 00:29.000
He left behind a map that shows you where this gem is hidden.
